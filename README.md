### About Me ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Software Engineer with passion about technologies.

My current skillset contains some of Java, Spring, Spring Boot, Groovy, Grails, Hibernate, Jenkins, Docker, Unit and Integration Testing, Spock Framework, Relational Data Bases and a few more things...

I've experience working with remote and on-site teams and I like to share my knowledge and learn from others to get a continue self improvement.

Please take a look to my projects here where I personally place some examples of workshops that I give, some repos are outdated but they are still here because I love to learn from my mistakes.
